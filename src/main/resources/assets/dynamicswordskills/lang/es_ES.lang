skill.dss.gui.description=SKILL DESCRIPTION
skill.dss.gui.summary=SUMMARY
skill.dss.gui.explanation=Sword skills are acquired by finding and using skill orbs, and all sword skills first require knowledge of the Basic Sword Technique.\nBy default, a basic skill orb is granted upon first joining a world; more may be acquired either through exploration or combat.\nEvery skill is activated in a unique fashion, and each use adds a certain amount of exhaustion. Like any other strenuous activity, physical combat requires lots of energy.\nExhaustion is part of the vanilla hunger mechanic - please see the online Wiki for more information. As a reference, a normal attack adds 0.3 exhaustion.

Higher tiers of armor are harder to knock off, even harder if enchanted with Unbreaking; Sharpness weapons gain a bonus to disarmor.\nNote that attacking too early, too late, or not from behind will only result in a standard attack.
skill.dss.back_slice.info.angle=Attack Angle: %d degrees

skill.dss.dodge.info.bonus=Max Timing Bonus: +%d%%
skill.dss.dodge.info.chance=Probabilidad de esquivar: %d%%

skill.dss.ending_blow.activation=While locked on and after striking the same opponent consecutively two or more times, quickly tap forward twice and attack.
skill.dss.ending_blow.description=Throw an enemy off balance with consecutive blows and press the advantage with a ferocious attack to finish the enemy off.\nWhen used to finish off an enemy, bonus experience is awarded equal to the skill level of the player, plus an additional amount up to the final remaining health value of the slain foe.\nThis skill is not without risk, however; should the enemy survive, you will be flat-footed and vulnerable for the duration listed, or twice that time if your attack misses completely. Reckless use of this skill may very well result in an untimely demise.
skill.dss.ending_blow.tooltip=Finish off a vulnerable enemy
skill.dss.ending_blow.hud.activate=Finish him!

skill.dss.leaping_blow.description=A powerful technique, the leaping blow is capable of striking and debilitating many foes at once. Enemies within the area of effect are weakened in addition to taking damage.\nTargets are affected based on their proximity to the center of the attack path; those further to the sides suffer less damage and a reduced weakness duration.\nDamage is calculated based on the attack bonus of the weapon used to perform the attack, plus bonus damage proportional to the skill level of the attacker.

skill.dss.mortal_draw.name=Ataque Relampago
skill.dss.mortal_draw.activation=While locked on and empty- handed, hold the block key and press attack right as an enemy's strike is about to land; requires a sword to be in the hotbar.
skill.dss.mortal_draw.description=Battoujutsu, also known as the art of unsheathing or drawing the sword, is one of the most difficult and deadly skills to master.\nWhen executed properly, the incoming attack is not only entirely neutralized, but the attacker is left completely vulnerable to attack, allowing the sword master to strike with the utmost efficacy.\nA successful battoujutsu inflicts double damage to the target, including all enchantment bonuses. This skill cannot be used in quick succession, as the sword must be placed back in its sheath before it may again be drawn.
skill.dss.mortal_draw.tooltip=Una devastadora tecnica de desenfundado rápido
skill.dss.parry.name=Rechazar
skill.dss.parry.activation=While locked on, tap back just as an incoming attack is about to land to parry. Only weapon- or item-based attacks may be parried.
skill.dss.parry.description=Parrying is a fundamental defensive skill, even more powerful than blocking as it will completely negate damage when successful, as well as possibly disarming an attacker. The chance to disarm is affected greatly by timing, and is the sole deciding factor amongst opponents of equal skill.\nNote that it is impossible to parry natural attacks such as the feared zombie punch or creeper blast; only attacks with weapons or items may be parried.

skill.dss.basic_technique.name=Habilidad Básica
skill.dss.basic_technique.activation=Press the Z-Targeting key, default 'x', with a target in clear sight and within the maximum range.
skill.dss.basic_technique.description=The most basic technique revolves around awareness of one's opponents, always keeping an enemy in sight. This is the foundation of all other combat skills, and is typically referred to as "locking on."\nConsecutive strikes while locked on build upon each other to form a "combo," each strike becoming more powerful than the last as the combo grows, provided that each strike is dealt before the timer expires. Landing a blow resets the timer for the next strike.\nThe combo ends when one of the following occurs: the maximum combo size is reached, the combo timer expires before the next successful strike, or the player suffers damage from a single source exceeding their damage tolerance.
skill.dss.basic_technique.info.max=Max Combo Size: %d
skill.dss.basic_technique.info.tolerance=Damage Tolerance: %s
